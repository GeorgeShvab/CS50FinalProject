This is readmy file for my CS50 final project.<br/>
My final project is a website for creating and taking this surveys by link.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly I need to say that my english if not perfect, so readme file and some code or text of project proubably contain typos(typos in words, that do not affect code).<br/>
Also, firstly I did this website in Ukrainian, so some words i code can be not translated.<br/>
<br/>

Also, I deployed this app on heroku, you can find it here https://yumforcs50.herokuapp.com/<br/>

## **Why I choose to do survey project**

I choose survey project because I wanted to do something that can be usefull.<br/>
Project like this can be easily used in school or university by me as a university student or by my father who is a teacher in school.<br/>

<br/>

## **About project**

### **Project languages and libraries**

For my project I used NodeJs with Express on backend. I didn't used python cause I know JS better than python.<br/>
As a database I used mongoDb instead of some of SQL database<br/>
For frontend I used some javascript and of course HTML, CSS and SCSS.<br/>
Instead of Jinja I used Handlebars engine and syntacys<br/>
Except Express I used some libraries like jsonwebtoken, cookei-parser, mongoose etc.<br/>

### **Project structure**

Root of my project has main files like config.json, package.json, index.js, router.js, etc.<br/>
Also, there are 8 folders in root.<br/>
Controllers folder contains controllers for http requests cathcing and main logic.<br/>
Dao folder contains files with data access operations, like queries to database.<br/>
Middlewares folder contains only one middleware for login checking.<br/>
I am not shoore if you will see node_modules folder, cause it ignored by git, there are libraries for backend that i used.<br/>
Public folder contains files, that will be requested from client's browser like css files, JS files, etc.<br/>
Schemas folder contains models or schemas for database.<br/>
SCSS folder contains scss code that was compiled in simple CSS to public/styles folder<br/>
Views folder contains Handlebars templates<br/>

### **Pages of website**

-   Home: /
-   Docs: /documentation
-   Sign In: /login
-   Sign Up: /registration
